# List of plugins compatible with Arduino IDE 2.x
## Introduction
Welcome to the Arduino IDE 2.x compatible extensions repository! This repository was created to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of extensions that can be used with version 2.x of the Arduino IDE. The idea is to facilitate access and use of these extensions by the community, contributing to more efficient and improved development.

The initial proposal to maintain this list in a public repository arose from the need to centralize information about extensions compatible with the Arduino IDE.

## Contributions
Contributions to this list are welcome! If you know of an extension that should be included, please open an **issue** with the extension information. Our goal is to keep this list dynamic and always updated to better serve the Arduino community.

## Plugin List Contents
### Extensions that depend on the Arduino-specific data API
1. [Arduino LittleFS Upload](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload): Extension for uploading files to the LittleFS file system of Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040, ESP8266 and ESP32 Arduino core devices.

1. [Arduino Sketch Vault](https://github.com/devista-consulting/arduino-sketch-vault): Integration of sketch [build profiles](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/sketch-project-file/#build-profiles) for Arduino IDE.

1. [ESP Exception Decoder](https://github.com/dankeboy36/esp-exception-decoder):
ESP8266/ESP32 exception decoder extension for Arduino IDE. This tool is essential for decoding and understanding exceptions generated by ESP devices.

1. [Arduino Spiffs Upload](https://github.com/espx-cz/arduino-spiffs-upload):
SPIFFS uploader compatible with Arduino IDE 2.2.1 or higher. For use with the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 Arduino core arduino-pico, the community ESP8266 Arduino core and the community ESP32 Arduino core.

1. [Teensy Security Plugin](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/secure_plugin_vscode):
This plugin supports use of code security on Teensy 4.x by adding commands to Arduino IDE.

1. [Extension Manager](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Extension-Manager): Manage installed extensions in Arduino IDE 2.x - enable, disable, install, and uninstall extensions directly from the IDE. Compatible with Arduino IDE 2.6.7 or higher.

1. [Arduino+](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Arduinoplus): Adds essential features that are missing from the standard Arduino IDE, delivering a more efficient and productive coding experience by allowing quick line commenting and uncommenting for easier debugging, instant duplication of code lines, advanced management and reuse of multiple code snippets through an enhanced snippet manager, and the creation of sketch anchors to quickly navigate to specific positions within the code. Compatible with Arduino IDE 2.6.7 or higher.

1. [AI.duino](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/AI.duino): AI.duino integrates the API providers Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, Perplexity and Cohere, Croq, aggregator services OpenRouter and Hugging Face, and local providers Claude Code, Codex CLI, LM Studio and Ollama directly into the Arduino IDE for intelligent code assistance. Compatible with Arduino IDE 2.6.7 or higher.

### Projects in Development
1. [ESP Network Monitor](https://github.com/Quency-D/esp-network-monitor): Used to monitor data sent over the ESP32 network port. Its condition is in an early stage of development.
2. [RooCode](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code): Provides integration with local or external AI models (such as OpenAI) for programming assistance. Currently, it is not fully compatible with Arduino IDE 2.x — installation and model detection work, but the chat functionality fails. It is known to work properly with TheiaIDE.


### Standard VS Code Extensions
In addition to the extensions specific to Arduino IDE 2.x, there are a wide range of standard VS Code extensions that are supported. These extensions are well tracked by the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/), making searching and installation easier of new resources. An example is the [WakaTime extension for Arduino IDE](https://github.com/wakatime/vscode-wakatime) (Installation instructions at [wakatime.com/arduino-ide](https://wakatime.com/arduino-ide)), which allows fully automatic time tracking to assist with time management on each project.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank [ptillisch](https://forum.arduino.cc/u/ptillisch/) and also [earlephilhower](https://github.com/earlephilhower) for the support and the idea in creating this list of extensions compatible with Arduino IDE 2.x. Your contributions have been invaluable to the community and will help many developers optimize their Arduino projects.
